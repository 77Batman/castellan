# DECISION RECORD — Castellan Capital

Every firm decision, its dissent, its conditions, its review date, its falsifier.
Append-only. Newest at the bottom.

## D-001 · 2026-07-28 · Firm activation (Charter Part IX)

**Decision:** Castellan Capital activated under Charter v1.1 (Amendments A1–A4).
Paper book opened at USD 10,000,000. Trial registry initialized empty.
Nine seats registered as invocable subagents.

**Verdict:** ACTIVATED — cold start, no operating continuity recovered.

**State at activation:**

| Item | State |
|---|---|
| `book/book.db` | cash 10,000,000.00 · 0 positions · reconcile clean · 0 orders / 0 executions / 0 trades |
| `book/registry.db` | 0 hypothesis families · 0 trials · 0 gate verdicts |
| `book/vaults/` | empty — no holdout locked |
| `book/pit.db` | **does not exist** — no price data ingested |
| `harness` | installed editable · 30/30 tests pass |
| `research/` `logs/` | empty prior to this record |

**Named dissent:** none — activation is mechanical, not a judgment call.

**Conditions attached:** no hypothesis may enter Gate 0 until the PIT store exists
and a holdout is locked for the relevant dataset. See I-001.

**Review date:** first Weekly Research Review after the Principal approves an agenda.

## D-002 · 2026-07-28 · Seat registration path

**Decision:** `.claude/agents` symlinked to `agents/`, making the nine seat
definitions discoverable by the Agent tool. `agents/` remains the single source
of truth and stays under version control.

**Rationale:** the seat definitions were present in the repo but not on the
discovery path. The roster existed as prose and could not be delegated to.

**Open condition:** Principal to confirm the seats appear under `/agents`. If
symlink resolution fails, fall back to copied files and accept the drift risk.
