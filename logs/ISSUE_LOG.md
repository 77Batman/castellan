## I-001 · 2026-07-28 · No data layer exists · Severity: MEDIUM · Owner: head-of-data-infra

**Description.** `book/pit.db` does not exist. No prices, no funding rates, no
filings have been ingested. Under Amendment A4 research may consume prices only
through `pit_adjusted_close` / `pit_price_panel`, so **every research line in the
firm is currently blocked on this**, not merely inconvenienced by it.

**Why it is logged rather than silently fixed.** It is the firm's critical path
on day one and its schedule risk belongs on the record, not in a CIO summary.

**Resolution:** open. Blocking condition on all Gate 0 admissions.
**Pattern tag:** `critical-path-infrastructure`

## I-002 · 2026-07-28 · Forward-lag legacy claim has unreconstructable N · Severity: HIGH · Owner: quant-validation

**Description.** The Principal's prior Polymarket forward-lag arbitrage work
(reported ~71.5% win rate, 5 tuned parameters, 1 regime exclusion) was produced
outside the harness. Under Amendment A2 its numbers are inadmissible, and under
§4.1 a result whose trial count N is unreconstructable makes every Part IV
statistic uncomputable.

**Consequence, stated in advance so it is not a surprise later:** the prior work
carries **zero evidentiary weight**. Re-validation begins at N = 0 with a fresh
pre-registration and a newly locked holdout. The prior result may inform *which*
hypothesis to test; it may not inform any threshold, parameter, or verdict. Any
use of the prior tuned parameters as starting values is itself a leak of trials
into the new count and must be declared if it happens.

**Resolution:** open — binding constraint on Pod B's first pre-registration.
**Pattern tag:** `inherited-unvalidated-claim`

## I-003 · 2026-07-28 · Principal-hypothesis base rate has no denominator yet · Severity: LOW · Owner: devils-advocate

**Description.** Charter Appendix B names failure mode #1 as *Principal-originated
hypotheses passing Gate 1 at a materially higher rate than others'*. Detecting it
requires a base rate, and the firm currently has zero resolved hypotheses of
either origin. The metric is therefore undefined and will remain uninformative
until roughly 8–10 hypotheses have reached a verdict.

**Consequence:** for the firm's first months, the anti-sycophancy guarantee rests
on structure (independent reporting lines) rather than on measurement. This is a
real gap and is stated rather than assumed away.

**Resolution:** open — tracked, first reported when n ≥ 8 resolved.
**Pattern tag:** `metric-undefined-at-cold-start`

## I-004 · 2026-07-28 · Forward-lag family may be inadmissible on data length · Severity: HIGH · Owner: quant-validation

**Description.** Charter §4.4 requires backtest length **≥ 4 years and ≥ 1 full
regime cycle**, with a holdout window **≥ 12 months**. The forward-lag family's
binding leg is Polymarket, whose history the Charter itself describes as thin
(§3.2). If usable contract history is under four years, the family **cannot pass
Gate 1 at any Sharpe** — the failure is evidentiary length, not absence of edge.

**Why this is filed at intake rather than discovered later.** §4.3 exists so that
impossibility is found at the cheapest stage. Spending Pod B's four Sonnet units on
a design that cannot reach a Gate would be exactly the waste the Gate 0 structure
is built to prevent.

**Interaction with P-1 (D-003):** because the holdout becomes `[C, G]` and grows
with elapsed calendar time, a family short on holdout today can become admissible
by waiting. That is the only legitimate use of elapsed time here — the in-sample
set does not grow with it.

**Blocking action:** Data & Infra reports **measured** usable Polymarket history as
its first deliverable, before Pod B spends a unit. Validation then rules ADMITTED /
ADMITTED-AS-EXPLORATORY / REJECTED at Gate 0.

**Resolution:** open.
**Pattern tag:** `evidentiary-length-ceiling`

## I-005 · 2026-07-28 · Harness holdout contract does not implement P-1 · Severity: HIGH · Owner: quant-validation → head-of-data-infra

**Description.** Principal amendment P-1 (D-003) requires that holdout data never
be fetched until Gate 1. `HoldoutVault.lock(df, passphrase)` requires the complete
series in hand at lock time and `open_once()` decrypts an already-stored payload.
The harness therefore **cannot express the regime the Principal just mandated**.

**Consequence.** A divergence between the Charter and the harness is a defect by
the Charter's own terms (Appendix D closing line). Until it is closed, any holdout
locked through the current code path violates P-1.

**Blocking action:** no ingest begins until Validation rules on the proposed
specification-sealing design and on whether cutoff `C` is pinned at
pre-registration. Data & Infra then implements to that ruling.

**Resolution:** open — blocks I-001.
**Pattern tag:** `charter-harness-divergence`

## I-006 · 2026-07-28 · Seats not invocable in the activation session · Severity: MEDIUM · Owner: fable-5-cio

**Description.** The nine seat definitions are on the discovery path and visible to
the Principal under `/agents`, but this session's agent registry was fixed at
startup — before `.claude/agents` existed — so `quant-validation` was not callable
by name. Dispatch failed with "Agent type not found."

**Workaround used, and its cost.** Validation Ruling 001 was dispatched through a
generic Opus agent instructed to read `.claude/agents/quant-validation.md` in full
and adopt it as its operating definition. This preserves the seat's instructions,
its independence framing, and its Opus tier. It does **not** preserve the
definition's `tools:` restriction, so the invoked agent held broader tool access
than the seat is scoped for.

**Why this is logged rather than absorbed.** Substituting a generic agent for a
registered independent seat is a structural change, and Charter house rule 7
forbids resolving those silently. The firm's independence guarantee rests on the
seat's instructions and on the CIO not overruling it — neither of which the
registry enforced anyway — so the degradation is narrower than it first appears.
It is still a degradation and it is on the record.

**Resolution:** self-clearing. A new session picks up the registered seats. Artifacts
are written to disk, so nothing is lost by restarting at any point.
**Pattern tag:** `session-startup-registry-lag`
